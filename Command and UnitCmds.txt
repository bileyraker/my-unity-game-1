Tools:
	Select
	Place
	Draw
	More to come I'm sure...
	
	Should these all use "brushes"? Some tools may not.
	Brushes:
		Rectangle
		Radius (circle)
		Lasso
		Paintbrush with adjustable radius?

Using a tool should be undoable, so it will use a command queue
	
Select:
	When something is selected, its commands should become available.
		Right click will hold a cursor-context-based default command. E.g:
			Targeting ground will be a move command for units. Rally command for buildings.
			Targeting enemy will be a target(?) command.
			Targeting ally will be a protect command.
		Right click hold can do something else.
		Right click hold and drag can do something else.
		Hotkeys or UI buttons available for other commands, sometimes requiring a left or right click afterwards for selecting a target (and maybe a hold or drag).
		Basically just modelling most RTS behavior.
		When a command hotkey or button is pressed, the player is selecting a target for that command.
			Each command should have a set of valid targets
				Ground, unit, building, resource, etc.
			Right click should cancel
				BUT right click drag should not cancel?
			Left click will select a target.
			Left click & drag will select an area to target? Based on the current selected tool brush, or just a radius/rect/lasso?
	Where should available commands come from?
		The ThingType?
		
Place:
	When placing something, options to build a spacing-adjustable grid should be available.
	Right click to cancel.
	Left click to place one and remove the item from brush.
	Shift + Left click to place one and keep item on brush.
	Left click + drag to place a line of items.
		
When a unit is deselected, those commands are no longer available.
