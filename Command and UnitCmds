	Should these all use "brushes"? Or will some tools not?

Using a tool should be undoable, so it will use a command queue
	
Select:
	When a unit is selected, its commands should become available.
		Right click has a default
		Right click hold can do something else
		Right click hold and drag can do something else
		Hotkeys for other commands will do something else, sometimes requiring a left or right click afterwards.
		Basically just model after BAR's behavior.
		When a command hotkey or button is pressed, the player is "holding" that command.
			Come up with a better name than holding?
			Each command should have a set of valid targets
				Ground, unit, building, resource, etc.
			Right click should cancel the hold
				BUT right click drag should not cancel
			Left click

	When placing
		
When a unit is deselected, those commands are no longer available.
